# Neural Models for Predicting Email Response Behavior
## Stanford CS224U Class Project - Spring 2018

Framework for deriving an email response dataset from the [Enron email corpus](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/) and training 
models on the dataset. Implements the models in Tensorflow and uses Jupyter notebooks to interact with them. If you have any 
questions, feel free to email me at <tucker.leavitt@gmail.com>.
