# Neural Models for Predicting Email Response Behavior
## Stanford CS224U Class Project - Spring 2018

Framework for deriving an email response dataset from the [Enron email corpus](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/) and training 
models on the dataset. Implements the models in Tensorflow and uses Jupyter notebooks to interact with them. For details,
see the full [report](./Neural_Models_for_Predicting_Email_Response_Behavior_Stanford_CS224U___Spring_2018.pdf) on this project.

#### Abstract
Modern email applications often highlight
important or anomalous emails to users.
Towards improving these applications, we
develop a neural network for the task of
predicting whether a user will respond to
an email, given the text of the email. We
derive an email response dataset from the
Enron email corpus. Using this dataset, we
train two types of models: a bi-directional
LSTM with attention, and a collaborative
filtering model that incorporates sender
and recipient information. Our best model
achieves an F1 score of 77.02, outperforming our baselines and existing machine
learning frameworks for the task.
